# Serverless FaaS Platform with OpenFaaS on Minikube

This guide presents a hands-on approach to deploying and working with a serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform using OpenFaaS, Minikube, Docker, and supporting tools like Helm and Prometheus. It walks through:

- Installing prerequisites (Docker, Minikube, faas-cli)
- Deploying OpenFaaS locally and on CloudLab
- Managing functions (e.g., `cows`, `figlet`, `hello-python`)
- Exposing and monitoring services with Prometheus and Grafana
- Creating and deploying custom Python functions
